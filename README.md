## Dynamic Pricing - A/B Testing - Sales Simulation
##### In this project I tried to apply A/B Testing to find out optimum price with a confidence intervall and simulate sales with different prices. Our goal is to ensure the maximum profit as predicted :)
##### A/B Testing is done without using # ANOVA because of educational purposes
##### The data we are going to use is consist of 2 columns which are Shop_id and Price.
##### The Shop_id represents 6 different shops and price is the amount that how much a customer wish to pay for a particular Item
##### Data set is created gathering survey answers taken place different shops.
##### This project considers that survey participants answered the questions with rationality
